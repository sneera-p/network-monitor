# Application Monitoring and Reporting System

## Overview

This application is designed to integrate with various monitoring and infrastructure tools, ingest data, process it, store it efficiently using Surreal DB with different data models, and provide reporting and alerting capabilities through a dashboard, Discord, and email.

The system is built around a modular architecture consisting of an Ingestor, a Reporter, and a central database (Surreal DB). It allows for centralized collection and analysis of data from diverse sources like Zabbix, Site24x7, Avamar, vSphere, and Citrix.

## Architecture

The system architecture is comprised of the following key components:

-   **Ingestor:** Responsible for collecting data from external monitoring and infrastructure tools such as Zabbix, Site24x7, Avamar, vSphere, and Citrix. It processes this raw data and prepares it for storage in the database.
-   **Surreal DB:** The central database for storing all collected and processed data. It is structured to handle various data types including:
    -   Devices (Graph data type, used by Reporter, Ingestor, Dashboard)
    -   Logs (Time Series data type, used by Reporter, Ingestor, Dashboard)
    -   Users (Document data type, used by Dashboard)
    -   Reports (File data type, used by Dashboard, Reporter)
-   **Reporter:** Processes data from Surreal DB to generate reports and insights. It also handles the distribution of information to output channels.
-   **Dashboard:** Provides a visual interface for users to view the status, reports, and metrics processed by the system.
-   **Output Channels:** The system can send alerts and reports to external communication platforms:
    -   Discord
    -   Email

Data flows from the external sources through the Ingestor to Surreal DB. The Reporter then accesses Surreal DB to generate outputs for the Dashboard, Discord, and Email.

## Key Features

* Integration with multiple monitoring platforms (Zabbix, Site24x7, Avamar, vSphere, Citrix).
* Flexible data storage using Surreal DB, supporting various data models (Graph, Time Series, Document, File).
* Ingestion and processing of diverse data types (logs, metrics, device info, etc.).
* Reporting generation based on stored data.
* Visualization of data through a dashboard.
* Alerting and notification via Discord and Email.

## Technologies Used

* **Database:** Surreal DB
* **Integration Points:** Zabbix, Site24x7, Avamar, vSphere, Citrix APIs/Interfaces
* **Output Channels:** Discord API, Email (SMTP)
* *(Further technologies for Ingestor, Reporter, and Dashboard would be specified here, e.g., Python, Go, Node.js, a specific web framework, etc.)*

## Setup and Installation

*(This section requires specific instructions based on the actual codebase and dependencies. Below is a general structure.)*

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * List required software and dependencies (e.g., Docker, specific language runtime, Surreal DB instance).
2.  **Cloning the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
3.  **Surreal DB Setup:**
    * Instructions on how to set up and configure the Surreal DB instance.
4.  **Configuration:**
    * Explanation of configuration files (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, output channel settings). Mention environment variables or configuration files to be updated.
5.  **Building and Running:**
    * Steps to build and run the Ingestor, Reporter, and Dashboard components. Provide examples using build tools or scripts.

## Configuration

Configuration is typically managed via configuration files or environment variables. Refer to the `config/` directory or the documentation for specific details on how to configure database connections, API endpoints, credentials, and notification settings.

## Usage

*(This section requires specific instructions on how to start the system, access the dashboard, and trigger reports or testing. Below is a general placeholder.)*

Once the system is set up and running:

* Ensure the Ingestor is connected to your monitoring sources.
* Access the dashboard via `http://localhost:<port>` (replace `<port>` with the actual port).
* Monitor the logs of the Ingestor and Reporter components for any errors.
